## Odin Restaurant Page

A simple restaurant page with dynamic DOM rendering with vanilla JavaScript using modular page components as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

Have a good day reading this.

## Key Features

- Fully dynamic content rendering using JavaScript modules.
- Navigation between **Home**, **Menu** and **About** sections.
- Modular code structure with ES6 modules.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES Modules) and Webpack (for bundling)

## To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aFlyingSeal/odin-restaurant-page.git

```

2. Install dependencies:

## Future Features:

- [x] Add a fading transition between each page so it doesn't feel as _instant_ as of now.
- [ ] Extend the content of each page (It's looking quite empty right now)
